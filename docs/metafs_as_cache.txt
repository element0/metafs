# METAFS AS CACHE LAYER

The MetaFS can be used as a cache layer
to buffer requests from another pyfilesystem
via an ADAPTOR FILESYSTEM.


ADAPTOR FILESYSTEM

A filesystem method, such as `readtext()` or `getinfo()` will first try the MetaFS layer. If no data exists, then try the TARGET FILESYSTEM. The result is written into the MetaFS layer as a buffer for the next time the method is called.

`writetext()` and `setinfo()` both update the MetaFS, which causes 'delta' state to be written to a queue.

A `flushall()` method will read the delta queue and push changes to the TARGET FILESYSTEM.
